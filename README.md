# Music-Player
I have created a music player. I have used HTML, CSS, javascript and jquery to build my project. This music player is capable of doing all the basic stuffs that an actual music player does, like playing/pausing a song, playing the next and prev songs.
The background image of the body is also changing with the click of the buttons. I have added blur effect for the background image.
I have also added music list feature in this, so that an user can play a song from the available list of songs. It highlights the song which is currently playing with a different color
So, this music list container which you see is dynamically created using jquery.
Also, it has a night mode Feature.
